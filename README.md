# Gardening App

This is the client side portion of my serverless Gardening App.
Users can sign in and add garden beds, as well as plants to each bed.
Based on the previous year's crops, the app can recommend plants for the next year using a five year plant rotation cycle.

It is built using React and Bootstrap.
